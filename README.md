This robot is programmed to detect and follow a designated path marked on the arena with various challenges such as ramps, sharp turns, a maze section and with pick and place mechanism by using Arduino Uno. Also we used 5 IR sensors to detect the robot navigations, 2 IR sensors to obstacle detection and maze detection, Motor Driver(L298N) to control the movement of the DC motors, Servo motors to operate a gripper mechanism
